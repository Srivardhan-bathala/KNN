Import Libraries: Import the necessary libraries, including scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy.
Data Preparation: Load your dataset using Pandas, preprocess it as needed, and convert it into NumPy arrays. This involves steps like handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting the data into features (independent variables) and the target variable
Create a KNN Model: Instantiate a KNN model object. In scikit-learn, this is done using the KNeighborsClassifier class.
Train the Model: Fit the KNN model to your training data. This is where the model learns the patterns in the data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model. This step involves making predictions on the test set and comparing them with the actual target values.
Use the Model for Prediction: Once trained and evaluated, you can use the model to make predictions on new data.
